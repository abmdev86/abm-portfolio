        Flexible Software Engineer gifted at implementing backend solutions with
        security, accessibility, and reusability in mind. Communicates
        productively with both technical and non-technical personnel and clients
        in support or solutions. Love to learn and share knowledge among peers.
        Gain more, give more. I enjoy working in .NET, NODE with React/VUE,
        Docker for Linux dev environments, and Unity3D. I have experience with
        PHP, setting up and routing with Virtualization in Apache, web hosting,
        cloud infrastructures in AWS and Azure and working toward certifications
        in the .NET environment. When I am not developing I like to play video
        games, I am a Diablo / Lost Ark geek unless I need to relive some Army
        days then its the Call of Duty and Rainbow Six. Outside of gaming I like
        to volunteer mentoring others in developing, spend time with my family
        going to parks, events, movies, etc. My main drive for developing is the
        challenges you face with debugging issues, the amount of knowledge you
        gain from fixing issues, and the ultimate feeling of success when you
        launch a new feature! I have had a long history of supporting others
        through military, IT, and development. My goals are to continue this
        trend with a more focus on software development and provide people the
        tools and applications to help them with their dreams, goals or career.
        Eager to learn, team player, and always looking to improve! I am
        Auroiah, nice to meet you !
